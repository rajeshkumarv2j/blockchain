Hi Team,

Environment setup..

I think we should go for Hyperledger-fabric

Hi,
 
I found this implementation , though I haven’t checked the code.

Hi Team,
 
This is our idea.
 
We should start the implementation..
 
 
 
Single source of truth for Provider data
Theme: Single Source of Healthcare Truth
About the idea
Today, health care stakeholders usually keep separate records and copies of their provider data. This separation can result in time-consuming and expensive processes to update and reconcile information when discrepancies are found. It's estimated that over $2 billion is spent annually across our health care system on updating and maintaining accurate provider data, an expensive and potentially unnecessary expense.
We propose a blockchain solution to create a national, single-source-of-truth for provider credentialing and demographic data shared across payers, providers and patients. Patients would trust that the provider data they are given is accurate and up-to-date, allowing for better patient referrals. Payers would reduce costs associated with rework due to incorrect claims. Shared details may include •Demographics •Office hours •Certifications •Specialties
•Features that are good to have Complex cryptographic and encryptions
•Constraints Large scale Provider data
 
 
 
Thanks & Regards,
Rajesh
